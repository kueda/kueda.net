To avoid the harmful effects of synthetic herbicides, considerable effort has been devoted to finding alternative products derived from natural sources. Essential oils (EOs) from aromatic plants are auspicious source of bioherbicides. This review discusses phytotoxic EOs and their chemical compositions as reported from 1972 to 2020. Using chemometric analysis, we attempt to build a structure-activity relationship between phytotoxicity and EO chemical composition. Data analysis reveals that oxygenated terpenes, and mono- and sesquiterpenes, in particular, play principal roles in the phytotoxicity of EOs. Pinene, 1,8 cineole, linalool, and carvacrol are the most effective monoterpenes, with significant phytotoxicity evident in the EOs of many plants. Caryophyllene and its derivatives, including germacrene, spathulenol, and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone, are the most effective sesquiterpenes. EOs rich in iridoids (non-terpene compounds) also exhibit allelopathic activity. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the phytotoxic activity of these compounds in pure forms, determine their activity in the field, evaluate their safety, and assess their modes of action.},

              Plants commonly employ indirect resistance to reduce herbivory by provisioning predatory arthropod populations with additional resources. Numerous predatory arthropods consume pollen that is entrapped on dense, wooly trichomes of plants. Over two seasons, we supplemented pollen on the wooly leaves of turkey mullein,
              Croton setiger
              , in natural populations to determine if pollen entrapped on leaves supplements predatory arthropods and reduces herbivore populations and damage to the plant. Pollen supplementation increased the abundance of predatory spiders in both years and omnivorous
              Orius
              bugs in 1 yr but had no effect on predatory hemipterans. Pollen supplementation reduced the abundance of herbivorous fleahoppers. Pollen supplementation decreased the amount of leaf damage experienced by plants over the season, suggesting that pollen entrapment may act as an indirect resistance. While
              C. setiger
              plants have little control over the amount of pollen on their surfaces, pollen adds to the diet of predatory arthropods that reduce herbivory, thus attraction of predators may be an adaptive benefit of leaf structures such as wooly trichomes that entrap pollen.},

              Plant‐provided foods for predatory arthropods such as extrafloral nectar and protein bodies provide indirect plant defence by attracting natural enemies of herbivores, enhancing top‐down control. Recently, ecologists have also recognised the importance of carrion as a food source for predators. Sticky plants are widespread and often entrap and kill small insects, which we hypothesised would increase predator densities and potentially affect indirect defence. We manipulated the abundance of this entrapped insect carrion on tarweed (Asteraceae:
              Madia elegans
              ) plants under natural field conditions, and found that carrion augmentation increased the abundance of a suite of predators, decreased herbivory and increased plant fitness. We suggest that entrapped insect carrion may function broadly as a plant‐provided food for predators on sticky plants.},

              The role of extracellular water in ameliorating drought stress was examined in
              Hemizonia luzulifola
              , an annual composite that comprises two subspecies differing significantly in the amount of extracellular polysaccharide within basal leaves. Rosette leaves of the high polysaccharide (HP) ssp were more than 30\% pectin on a dry weight basis in contrast to only 4\% in the low polysaccharide (LP) ssp. Concomitant with this difference in polysaccharide content was a significant difference in the dehydration response of leaves. Near full hydration, relative capacitances of HP leaves (0.7 MPa
              ‐1
              ) were an order of magnitude greater than the LP leaves (0.08 MPa
              ‐1
              ). Relative capacitance of the polysaccharide alone was 1.5 MPa
              ‐1
              . The weight of water per unit leaf area was not significantly different in the two taxa. Nevertheless, the pectin‐like polysaccharides significantly altered the distribution of metabolically available water from primarily cell‐stored water in the LP ssp to apoplasmic and symplasmic capacitors in leaves of the HP ssp. The consequence of this apoplasmic water store with colloidal properties is that the Ψ‐dependence of leaf capacitance ceases to be linked directly to cell water relations. Transfer resistances for water movement between capacitors and the xylem near full hydration (0 to ‐0.5 MPa) were significantly larger in the HP leaf. This difference in transfer resistance was interpreted to be the result of a large resistance to water movement between the polysaccharide and the xylem. Because of these large transfer resistances, the apoplasmic capacitor probably buffers cells at lower water potentials under transient water fluxes than expected from laboratory measurements made during slow desiccation. Field measurements support this conclusions; HP leaves were better buffered than LP leaves at midday water potentials.},

              Premise
              Glandular trichomes are implicated in direct and indirect defense of plants. However, the degree to which glandular and non‐glandular trichomes have evolved as a consequence of herbivory remains unclear, because their heritability, their association with herbivore resistance, their trade‐offs with one another, and their association with other functions are rarely quantified.
            
            
              Methods
              
                We conducted a phylogenetic comparison of trichomes and herbivore resistance against the generalist caterpillar,
                Heliothis virescens
                , among tarweed species (Asteraceae: Madiinae) and a genetic correlation study comparing those same traits among maternal half‐sibs of three tarweed species.
              
            
            
              Results
              Within a tarweed species, we found no evidence that herbivore growth rate decreased on tarweed individuals or maternal sib groups with more glandularity or denser trichomes. However, tarweed species with more glandularity and fewer non‐glandular trichomes resulted in slower‐growing herbivores. Likewise, a trade‐off between glandular and non‐glandular trichomes was apparent among tarweed species, but not among individuals or sib groups within a species.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our results suggest that this key herbivore does not select for trichomes as a direct defense in tarweed species. However, trichomes differed substantially among species and likely affect herbivore pressure on those species. Our results demonstrate that trade‐offs among plant traits, as well as inference on the function of those traits, can depend on scale.},

              Freezing resistance mechanisms were studied in five endemic Hawaiian species growing at high elevations on Haleakala volcano, Hawaii, where nocturnal subzero (°C) air temperatures frequently occur. Extracellular freezing occurred at around ‐5°C in leaves of
              Argyroxiphium sandwicense
              and
              Sophora chrysophylla
              , but these leaves can tolerate extracellular ice accumulation to ‐15°C and ‐12°C, respectively. Mucilage, which apparently acted as an ice nucleator, comprised 9 to 11\% of the dry weight of leaf tissue in these two species. Leaves of
              Vaccinium reticulatum
              and
              Styphelia tameiameiae
              were also found to tolerate substantial extracellular freezing.
              Dubautia menziesii
              , on the other hand, exhibited the characteristics of permanent supercooling; a very rapid decline in liquid water content associated with simultaneous intracellular and extracellular freezing. However, in those species that tolerate extracellular freezing, the decline in liquid water content during freezing is relatively slow. Osmotic potential was lower at pre‐dawn than at midday in four of the species studied. Nocturnal production of osmotically active solutes may have helped to prevent intracellular freeze dehydration as well as to provide non‐colligative protection of cell membranes.
              Styphelia tameiameiae
              supercooled to ‐9·3°C and tolerated tissue freezing to below ‐15°C, a unique combination of physiological characteristics related to freezing. Tolerance of extracellular ice formation after considerable supercooling may have resulted from low tissue water content and a high degree of intracellular water binding in this species, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance studies. The climate at high elevations in Hawaii is relatively unpredictable in terms of the duration of subzero temperatures and the lowest subzero temperature reached during the night. It appears that plants growing in this tropical alpine habitat have been under selective pressures for the evolution of freezing tolerance mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This review examines how leaf trichomes influence leaf physiological responses to abiotic environmental drivers. Leaf trichomes are known to modulate leaf traits, particularly radiation absorptance, but studies in recent decades have demonstrated that trichomes have a more expansive role in the plant–environment interaction. Although best known as light reflectors, dense trichome canopies modulate leaf heat balance and photon interception, and consequently affect gas exchange traits. Analysis of published studies shows that dense pubescence generally increases reflectance of visible light and near-infrared and infrared radiation. Reflective trichomes are also protective, reducing photoinhibition and UV-B related damage to leaf photochemistry. Little support exists for a strong trichome effect on leaf boundary layer resistance and transpiration, but recent studies indicate they may play a substantive role in leaf water relations affecting leaf wettability, droplet retention and leaf water uptake. Different lines of evidence indicate that adaxial and abaxial trichomes may function quite differently, even within the same leaf. Overall, this review synthesises and re-examines the diverse array of relevant studies from the past 40 years, illustrating our current understanding of how trichomes influence the energy, carbon and water balance of plants, and highlighting promising areas for future research.},
